##Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic weather prediction model using machine learning. The notebook weather_prediction.ipynb includes steps for loading and preprocessing weather data, training a machine learning model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions. The objective is to provide a simple example of how to build and apply a predictive model to weather-related data.

##Instructions to Run the Code
>Clone the repository to your local machine if using GitHub.
>Install the required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
>Open the weather_prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
>Run all the cells in the notebook. The process includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions.

##Dependencies and Environment Details
This project requires Python version 3.8 or later. The following libraries are used:
>pandas
>Numpy
>matplotlib
>seaborn
>scikit-learn
